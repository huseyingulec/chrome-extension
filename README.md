# Lead's tracker chrome extension
    This is an extension that saves tabs and inputs, it does basic function that google readlist does. I am trying to make a personal google bookmark/readlist.

## What I have done;
    In this project, I have learnt some concept of JS such as const variable, difference between const and let variables, addEventListener, innerHTML, input.value, function parameters, difference between parameters and arguments, template strings, most importantly localStorage, setting and getting item in localStorage, JSON objects, JSON.parse and JSON.stringify, objects in arrays.
